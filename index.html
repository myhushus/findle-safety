  <h1>Findle – Child Safety & Reporting Policy</h1>
  
  <p>
    Findle strictly prohibits any content related to child sexual abuse or exploitation (CSAE). We are committed to complying with all relevant child safety laws and regulations, including reporting obligations to local or national authorities where required by law.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If CSAE-related content is detected or reported, Findle will take immediate action, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Removing the content or suspending the account.</li>
    <li>Reporting the incident to relevant national or regional authorities.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    Users may report any child safety concerns directly within the app via the Settings → <strong>Report</strong> option,
    which opens your email client to contact us at:
    <a href="mailto:director@findle.me">director@findle.me</a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Alternatively, concerns can also be reported to the following external organizations:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.missingkids.org/gethelpnow/cybertipline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NCMEC CyberTipline (USA)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://inhope.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">INHOPE International Reporting</a></li>
  </ul>
